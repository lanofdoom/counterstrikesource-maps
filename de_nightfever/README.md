This is the final version of de_nightfever, the 3rd map of d00ds.com following de_losttemple and de_cpl_fire. de_nightfever is taking place in a modern office complex right after midnight. 

Terrorists have to disable the electricity by placing C4 on bombsite A or on the internet-connection area on bombsite B to hinder the transmission of important data.
Counter-Terrorists have to neutralize all terrorist forces or disarm the C4.

There are 4 main routes in the map: to the left using the streets to enter B, using the bridge to enter B, through the middle entering A or B and over the right roof to enter A

Please feel free to host the map for download or on your gameserver.

Original download @ http://d00ds.com

Attention Server Admins:
Since the map is larger than 16MB with all the custom content, put "net_maxfilesize 64" into server.cfg to allow download of the map.
However with BZIP2, it is from now on possible to compress large files which the players must download before being able to play (e.g. Maps...) This way you can reduce the size of the de_nightfever download from 44MB to 22MB. Also the file gets downloaded from your fast webserver. That allows an enormous saving of time at the time of the remote loading. 
Just follow these easy steps:
* Download the file "de_nightfever.bsp.bz2" @ http://files.ingame.de/counterstrike/gameserver/maps/de_nightfever.bsp.bz2
* In your server.cfg set "sv_downloadurl http://www.yourURLgoeshere.com/cstrike". (insert your own domain name)
* In the public_html directory (default) of your webserver create a new folder "cstrike" and a subfolder "maps".
* Place the file "de_nightfever.bsp.bz2" in the folder "cstrike/maps" on the webserver via ftp.
* Keep in mind you still need to install the map de_nightfever.bsp on your gameserver as you would normally do.
