web: http://assaultnbattery.com
Spawns: 32
Overview: none
Textures: Compiled into map
File Size: 4.22 MB
Zipped: 2.00 MB
Bugs: none that I know of
Released: December 12, 06
Thanks to: Terreto, Cranium, Procto, Lade, Munra to name just a few for helping with the beta test.

Description: Made for Gun Game but I have included buy zones to keep it playable in case a Valve update screws up Mani or Event Scripts etc. :^)

Info: Falling, Jumping or Swimming in the water will get you killed. There is 1 sniper spawn spot above each team on a cliff with a rope to climb down, all other spawns are on ground level. Besides some minor displacement use I did on a previous map this is my first attempt with walls.. Feedback in any form would be appreciated.
