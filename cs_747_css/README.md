thoughts on the camera?

thanks all for the bug reports

beta test 2
most textures have been replaced
changed the barricade at the end of the plane
changed a few of the vent textures/switched some to the militia phys vents
replaced the light textures in 747 with models
changed the stove brush to a model

bugs that have been noticed:
no hdr this time (the lighting is messed up, hopefully i can figure what happened)
doors have shadows where the knobs should be
cockpit of the plane has bad brushes (same with outside of the plane)
uppermost hostage has trouble going down the stairs (he doesnt, just shoot him)
it might be a bit brighter outside from the lights in the windows

beta test 1
i'm doing the same thing with this map that i did with upc
basic conversation>textures/detail>bugs

the brushes on the airplane arent the greatest
theres about of 2k vislines to trim down

not sure what to do about the airplane textures
i'll probably leave the original ones unless someone wants to do them :)
