The Matrix v1.1 for CS:S

--READ ALL PLEASE--


IMPORTANT ADMINS: The Matrix map is big! If you want people to be able to download the map directly from your server, you must use this command:

net_maxfilesize 27

Default 16mb. The Matrix map is 25mb.

Without this command changed to 27, people will download all the resources EXCEPT the .BSP and they will get an error message like "de_thematrix_11.bsp not found".
-->If your server BZIPs the maps you're ok, but make sure you test it first.

-------------------------------
Changelog for the Matrix 1.1:
-------------------------------

-Visual improvements in the Lobby, Dojo sidehall and backhall, Elevator, Office corridor and Rooftops.

-Improved .NAV system for bots. They're bad asses now, even level 1 bots! They throw grenades when they should and the correct type, and they plant on both bombsites evenly. They use the teleporters efficiently.

-Fixed issue with people getting stuck out of the elevator: they're teleported in the white room if stuck outside.

-Slight performance improvements in some rooms.

-Improved Dojo and Office destruction FX.

-Enlarged some doorways for easier access.

-The lighting with flashlight and cubemaps problems were automatically fixed by the 9/23 update.

-Other minor fixes


-----------------------------------------
Major known issues with the Matrix 1.1:
-----------------------------------------

-The elevator is still shaky. Elevators aren't working perfectly online because they bump into players and players bump into each other so sometimes you feel like everything's shaking. This will never be better until it is improved by Valve.

-The elevator might be missing when you start a new round but short after, the doors shut and you can't see the problem anymore. This is a bug related to timers and outputs for certain objects. The timers don't reset between rounds in CS:S for unknown magical reasons. The problem was reported to Valve and the future will tell us if it will be fixed or not.

-Limited bot support: they get stuck sometimes but everything is fine other than that. They are smart-asses that hide in ducts, use teleporters and use the elevator efficiently. They just get stuck from time to time.

-DirectX 8 mode: The map seems to present minor texture bugs when run in directx 8 mode. Nothing important, things like grainy white texture in the white room or some textures are super shiny when they're not shiny in dx9 mode. There seem to be issues with swap buffers also when details are set too high in dx 8 mode.

-DirectX 7 mode: the matrix zone hack texture (the weird liquidish one) shows up as plain white or plain green in Dx7 mode. Also, the same problems found when run in DX8 mode are here too. Grainy textures. But no reflection problems since there are no such things in DX7 mode.



---------------------------
