Every round 1 player chooses the map that everyone is going to play.
Thanks to DeleHai for a great map, to Generalvivi for sign-textures and to iwannamap.com for great help with mapping.

Notes:
If you are choosing the map, you have 10 seconds time after the spawn doors open.
If somebody purposely doesn't choose the map or blocks your way to the map-choosing-area, the spawn doors will open automatically in 10 seconds.
After the map has been chosen, you have 20 seconds time to go to the teleport before dying.
If somehow 2 maps are chosen at the same time, the doors will close and you must choose again.
```
