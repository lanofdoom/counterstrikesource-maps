De_Rats by RomeoJGuy
--------------------

*Thank You for Downloading*

This is a port of the de_rats map from CS1.6, but instead of just taking the old map and decompiling it
and going from there I built everything by hand. Here is a rundown of the updates:
*The window actually has an outside thanks to 3d skyboxes.
*The fridge recieved upgrades of snowy and displacement mapped ground.
*The Water is updated to CSS standards.
*All objects are physicsable meaning lots of different interesting kills
*Clock can be shot off the wall and smash you.
*Added more sponges to the sponge tub to allow for fights on there.
*Updated the bug spray with new source effects.
*Oven uses new source heat wave effects and is now accessible in the oven. (It requires a master jumper, and will hurt you to get there)
*Cabinet has been upgraded with new items like a box of nails and a marble trap.

I am sure you will enjoy. I know the pre-sdk people have. Thanks.
